# Text_Summarization

📌 Overview

Text Summarization is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that aims to generate a concise and meaningful summary from a large body of text while preserving the original context and key information. This project implements abstractive text summarization using BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), a powerful transformer-based model developed by Facebook AI.

BART is well-suited for summarization tasks because it combines the strengths of both encoder–decoder architectures, enabling it to understand the full context of the input text and generate fluent, human-like summaries.
